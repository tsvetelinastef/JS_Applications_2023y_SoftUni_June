how to create request? 
- with "Postman"

... for example ... if we try to make some request with the website "Swapi"
and in Postman I go to the plus
and next to the "GET" I type:  "swapi.dev"  and we press the button next to it called "Send"
than down I see the response from the server ->  Unde button "Body" and "Header"
